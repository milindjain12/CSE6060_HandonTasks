In this notebook you can find the task of POS-Tagging, where a downloaded <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15474/15474-0.txt">Indian Mythology book Mahabharata (Volume 1)</a> from Gutenberg and formed word clouds for frequently occuring words on the basis of frequency distribution and conditional distribution.

### 4. POS_tagging_hindi.ipynb
In this notebook I tried using hindi corpus and try POS-Tagging them but I found already a corpus exists in nltk where POS_tagged words are present and also I was not finding the source to download some hindi corpus hence I didn't continue further.

### 5. 12.06.2020 Hands On Session.ipynb
This notebook contains the task of the 3rd Hands-On class, where we get to know how to use stopwords, classify the words as male and female as well as how to vectorize the text and use cosine similarity on the vectorized data.

### 6. Plagarism_Task.ipynb
This notebook contains the task for plagarism check but it is still a work in progress, it contains the work which I did until now.

### 6. (Hands On Session)19-06-2020.ipynb.ipynb

### 7. Exploring TextBlob.ipynb
In this jupyter notebook, I have explored various features provided by TextBlob library for NLP tasks like 
1. <b>Tokenization</b>
2. <b>part-of-speech tagging</b>
3. <b>Lemmatization</b>
4. <b>WordNetIntegration</b>
5. <b>Sentimental Analysis</b>
etc.

### 8. Using Using StanfordNLP(Stanza) Lib.ipynb
This jupyter notebook explores various function like tokenization, pos tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing on a <b>Hindi</b> corpus downloaded from internet using Stanza library (<b>StandfordNLP</b> library renamed to <b>Stanza</b>)

### 9. Embeddings.ipynb
In this notebook, worked an example of how to do <b>Word2Vec</b> embedding and in this I scraped a news article from a website (<a href="https://theprint.in/ilanomics/this-recession-is-different-india-can-bounce-back-much-faster-than-in-the-past/439612/">Link</a>).

### 10. LOR_Chunking.ipynb
